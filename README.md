# conan-anchore-example
This repo has an example of how Syft can generate an SBOM for a C/C++ based code base that uses Conan as the package manager to build software. It will covers how to import the SBOM into Anchore Enterprise. This allows you to manage the SBOMs and do things like identify vulnerabilities within those SBOMs
